PS: The Upside-Down Pay Gap (Exposing Gender Gap Inequality): Some inequalities, like the Upside Down, remain hidden beneath the surface. Gender-based pay disparities may exist within organizations but often remain unnoticed due to limited transparency and the sensitive nature of salary information. There is a need to identify and address unfair compensation patterns while ensuring confidentiality and protecting individual employee data.

The Solution:
DARPAN
DARPAN is a mirror-based analytics app that visualizes hidden gender inequality in the workplace by comparing two realities: Hawkins, the real world shaped by systemic delays, and the Upside Down, a neutral mirror world driven purely by merit. Using privacy-safe inputs, the app computes a merit score, infers structural friction from career delays, and shows how the same individual’s growth diverges across the two worlds through intuitive comparative graphs. By focusing on systems rather than individuals, DARPAN helps make invisible inequality visible—without exposing sensitive data or assigning blame.
